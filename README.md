# Go Separate
Ever had the desire to print really large numbers in a nice, neat way? If you have, you are in the right place!
This package provides a nice way to separate large numbers interpolating commas in the number to improve readability.

An example is below:

`fmt.Printf(fmtFormatLargeNumber(1000.0)); // '1,000'`

See the unit tests for more examples.
